<h4>Enterprise Software Development</h4>

<p>
    Enterprise software serves to address the specific needs of a company or organization. In my case, if you, as my client, have requested a website, I will not only provide you with the website itself but also suggest the creation of an Android or Windows program that allows you to edit the content of the website at your convenience. For example, if you change your phone number, you would be able to update it on your website, or if you change your email address, you could easily make that change as well.
</p>

<p>
    But it's not just limited to websites. You can ask me to create a program that helps you manage your business or company. For example, a program that stores employee information in a database and tracks their working hours, or a platform that allows your colleagues to send you files for review before sending them out, ensuring that they meet certain conditions. These are just a few examples, but the possibilities are endless as the needs of businesses continue to evolve.

<h4>Videogames Development</h4>

<p>
    Initially, I considered game development as my main focus, but I realized that the game development process often involved discarding work. However, I discovered that my true passion lies in creating graphical interfaces and developing virtual tools. I find great satisfaction in designing user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience and developing practical virtual tools that streamline processes and increase efficiency.

<h4>Some applications I have created</h4>

<p>
    I developed some applications for Android that were available on the Google Play Store. However, they ended up being canceled as I didn't feel they were appealing enough to the audience.

<ul id="examples-list-apps">
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Notas:</b> This application allowed for calculating students' averages in an organized manner.
        </p>

        <div class="image-placeholder" value="media/images/programming-examples/notas-examples/sample_1.webp">
            <div class="placeholder-loader" style="position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 16px); left: calc(50% - 16px);height: 32px; width: 32px; display: inline-block;"></div>

        <p>
            It had dark mode.
        </p>

    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Mensajes Aleatorios:</b> As its name suggests, this application allows you to send and receive random messages. In other words, you can send a message to a database and that message can reach another user.
        </p>

        <p>
            That was the homepage:
        </p>

        <div class="image-placeholder" value="media/images/programming-examples/random-msg-examples/sample_1.webp">
            <div class="placeholder-loader" style="position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 16px); left: calc(50% - 16px);height: 32px; width: 32px; display: inline-block;"></div>
            <img class="loading-image" alt="mensajes aleatorios, aplicación">
        </div>

        <p>
            There were various categories, my idea was for the community to suggest additional categories that could be added.
        </p>

        <div class="image-placeholder" value="media/images/programming-examples/random-msg-examples/sample_2.webp">
            <div class="placeholder-loader" style="position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 16px); left: calc(50% - 16px);height: 32px; width: 32px; display: inline-block;"></div>
            <img class="loading-image" alt="mensajes aleatorios, aplicación">
        </div>

        <div class="image-placeholder" value="media/images/programming-examples/random-msg-examples/sample_3.webp">
            <div class="placeholder-loader" style="position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 16px); left: calc(50% - 16px);height: 32px; width: 32px; display: inline-block;"></div>
            <img class="loading-image" alt="mensajes aleatorios, aplicación">
        </div>

        <p>
            This is how you could send a message. I must admit that I didn't make it very explanatory, I just created that visually striking interface without considering the needs of an average user.
        </p>

        <div class="image-placeholder" value="media/images/programming-examples/random-msg-examples/sample_4.webp">
            
            <div class="placeholder-loader" style="position: absolute; top: calc(50% - 16px); left: calc(50% - 16px);height: 32px; width: 32px; display: inline-block;"></div>
            <img class="loading-image" alt="mensajes aleatorios, aplicación">
        </div>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, despite being well-made applications, I created them using a game engine, specifically Godot Engine 3.5.1. Therefore, I couldn't afford to continue using a game engine for developing applications.
