<h4>Vector Desing</h4>
<p>
    The creation of graphics using vectors on a screen offers a range of significant benefits. One of the key highlights is the ability to scale without losing quality.

    I mostly worked on Dark People, which was a video game identical to the Five Nights at Freddy's series. However, I decided to cancel the project. I am amazed at the quality of the graphics, considering that I created them when I was still a novice.

<h4>Digital Drews</h4>

<p>
    Digital drawings strive to imitate a real canvas. That's why they differ from vector design, as this art is not rendered in real-time but consists of completely static pixels.
