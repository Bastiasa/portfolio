<h4>English proficiency</h4>

<p>
    I have a good understanding of the English language and can assist with translations. English is considered the universal language, so it is almost expected to have proficiency in it and can be considered a mandatory skill in today's globalized world.

<h4>Orality and public speaking</h4>

<p>
    I have no problems speaking in public in front of large audiences. My voice is eloquent and clear, and I even use a very neutral and inclusive language without changing the grammatical rules of Spanish. For reasonable reasons, I do not use "inclusive language," in case it was not clear. My eloquent way of speaking is also suitable for voice acting, as I am a very good actor.
