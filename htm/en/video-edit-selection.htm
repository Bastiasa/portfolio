<h4>Video Editing</h4>

<p>
    As a video editor, I possess a comprehensive skill set in utilizing a diverse range of editing platforms. I exhibit proficiency in adapting seamlessly to various software applications dedicated to the craft of audiovisual content creation. Presently, I predominantly operate with the esteemed DaVinci Resolve, an industry-leading solution renowned for its exceptional capabilities. It is important to emphasize that the art of video editing encompasses a multifaceted array of skills that are instrumental in delivering captivating and polished productions.

        <b>Audio Editing:</b> Audio holds paramount importance in the realm of multimedia production. I possess extensive experience in utilizing Audacity, a remarkable and free platform that enables professional-grade audio editing. While it may not offer the same extensive range of effects and capabilities as premium software options, Audacity provides the essential tools necessary for fundamental audio editing tasks. Its user-friendly interface and feature set allow for efficient and effective audio enhancement and manipulation.

        <b>Voice-over:</b> Throughout my life, I have always strived to have a neutral accent and clear pronunciation, avoiding adopting the regional accents of those around me. This commitment to clear and neutral verbal communication has allowed me to develop a distinct and articulate voice. Over the years, I have honed my speaking skills and improved my ability to convey ideas effectively through my voice. I take pride in my ability to communicate with clarity and eloquence, and I continue to refine my vocal skills to deliver compelling voice-over performances.

        <b>Graphic Animation:</b> This skill is closely related to vector design, as it allows me to create engaging animations that enhance understanding. And where do I get those circles, squares, and other shapes? That's right, from vector design. Graphic animation showcases professionalism and quality when executed correctly. By leveraging vector design techniques, I can bring static elements to life, adding movement and interactivity to enhance visual storytelling. The ability to create compelling graphic animations not only showcases my technical proficiency but also adds a dynamic and engaging element to any project.

        <b>Proficient command of the Spanish language: </b> During childhood, there are various educational gaps created by teachers, and I believe there is no subject with more gaps than Spanish. This can be observed on social media, government videos, and so on. I also admit to having had poor teachers, but at the same time, I had excellent educators who, although few in number, helped me improve my spelling almost perfectly. I have even seen government projects that make serious spelling mistakes, which makes me say, "That project needed Mr. Bastidas."

<h4>"Aportes, Día del Idioma"</h4>
<p>
    I also created this video for the same institution. Along with five students, I was asked to organize a dialogue that attempts to express and explain the importance of language and related aspects. Towards the end, you will see my presence in the video.
