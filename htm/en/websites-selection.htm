<h3>Web Development</h3>
<h4>Short Explanation</h4>
<p>
    The creation of custom websites without the use of predefined platforms offers numerous advantages and greater flexibility in terms of website functionalities. By opting for this approach, web designers and developers have full control over every aspect of the site, allowing them to create unique experiences tailored to the specific needs of their clients.

<h4>My experience</h4>
<p>
    I am relatively new to the field of web development; however, I have the confidence to deliver a product that upholds a high standard of quality. It is disconcerting to witness websites on the internet that exhibit subpar quality yet manage to generate revenue. I possess a comprehensive understanding of the internet as a whole, and I am particularly passionate about creating seamless user interfaces. I firmly believe that as a mobile user, I should not be subjected to the apathy and negligence of a web developer who fails to prioritize the adaptability of their website for smaller screens.
